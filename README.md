# Keras_Tutorial   
This is a tutorial about using a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) in order to separate a high mass spin 0 resonance decaying into hh -> WWbb -> lvlvbb from ttbar background.   

# Running locally:   
You need several packages to be installed (check the import part first). The inputs have to be copied grom brazos cluster.   
```
git clone https://github.com/lpernie/Keras_Tutorial.git   
cp -r /fdata/hepx/store/user/lpernie/MVA*root files/   
jupyter notebook Hhh_optimization.ipynb   
```
